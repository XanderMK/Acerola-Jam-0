A game created for Acerola Game Jam #0.

Tools used include:
- Blender
- Unity
- Material Maker (https://www.materialmaker.org/)
- Krita

Everything was hand drawn and modeled. All sound effects were produced by me (hopefully). Fonts "Roboto" and "Walkway" are public domain and free use, respectively, obtained from 1001 Free Fonts (https://www.1001freefonts.com/). :)
